# TeleAsk
Welcome to the chongsters

We used the Python-Telegram-Bot library to implement our Telegram bot. Our backend is coded in Python, using the Flask application framework to connect to our front-end website to the Flask server using REST API Requests. The front-end website is hosted separately on riccqi/Chongsters-Web.

Known bug of telebot being unresponsive to messages sometimes.
